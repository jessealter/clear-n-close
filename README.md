Clear 'n Close
=====================
A script for [Textual 5](https://www.codeux.com/textual/). Does what it says.
(It clears the ZNC buffer, and closes the window)

Installation
=====================
If you got Textual from the Mac App Store, put it here:
```
~/Library/Application Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual5/
```
If not, then put it here:
```
~/Library/Application Scripts/com.codeux.apps.textual/
```
If the directory that you need is missing, create it.
